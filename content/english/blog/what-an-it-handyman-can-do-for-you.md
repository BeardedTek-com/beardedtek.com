In today’s digital world, technology is part of everything we do — until it stops working. That’s where an IT Handyman steps in. Think of them like a tech-savvy problem-solver who can come to your home or business and fix your tech issues without the jargon or the hassle. Whether you're a small business owner or just trying to get your home Wi-Fi back up, an IT Handyman can make your tech life easier in so many ways.

### On-Site Tech Support

When something breaks or just won’t work, there’s nothing like having a real person show up and fix it on the spot. An IT Handyman provides on-site support for everything from slow computers and crashed software to faulty network connections. They can diagnose issues, repair or replace components, and walk you through how to avoid the problem next time — all without you needing to unplug anything or visit a store.

### Remote Tech Support

Not all tech problems need a house call. For quick fixes, software updates, or troubleshooting strange pop-ups, an IT Handyman can log in remotely and solve the issue while you watch. Remote support is especially useful for those who want fast, cost-effective solutions or just need a little help getting through a software setup.

### Installing a New Router

Whether you're upgrading your Wi-Fi for faster speeds or switching internet providers, setting up a new router can be more complicated than just plugging it in. An IT Handyman can:
- Help you choose the right router for your needs
- Set it up securely
- Optimize placement for the best signal
- Configure your network name, password, and devices

They'll also make sure everything from your smart TV to your home office printer is connected and running smoothly.

### Installing a New Printer

Printers can be notoriously frustrating to install — especially when you’re dealing with drivers, network setup, or wireless configurations. An IT Handyman can:
- Unbox and physically set up your printer
- Install the correct drivers on your devices
- Connect it to your Wi-Fi network
- Troubleshoot any printing errors

Whether it's for a home office or shared use in a small business, they’ll make sure it’s ready to print without issues.
